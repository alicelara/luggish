# today / tomorrow:

# make an 'admin' view (don't worry about the word admin)
# which lets you add luggish-team approved items.

# items#index -> lets you see all the luggish-approved items (or maybe even user items)

# items#new -> lets you add a new item
	# name
	# category_id and then eventually pick and choose an actual category
	# maybe optionally tags
	# NOT user -> this has to be blank for it to be a 'luggish system item'

	# when I save this record, it should do a POST

# items#edit -> in order to edit an existing item
	# name
	# category_id
	# maybe add / subtract some tags
	# maybe allow the admin to delete the item from this view

	# when I save this record, it should....PATCH / PUT
	# when I delete this record, it should do a DELETE

# items#create
